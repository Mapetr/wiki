Make sure youâ€™re in **object mode** and in [front orthographic](../Object%20mode%205d7f4d1a5e73459fa1561248946ec210.md).

[Add an object](../Object%20mode%205d7f4d1a5e73459fa1561248946ec210.md) and select **reference** and select your front image.

Now [rotate to other side](../Object%20mode%205d7f4d1a5e73459fa1561248946ec210.md) and do the same.
